Well. Finally got around to putting this website together. 

A good point to start was [Creating and Hosting a Personal Site on GitHub](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/).

After installing [ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) you can start a local server with the following command 

```
jekyll serve --watch
```

and henceforth you can use [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) to author your posts.
